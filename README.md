# Resto Druid Spell Uptime Trackers
> This is an addon for World of Warcraft I wrote in 2014, and is out of date as of the Legion prepatch. Hopefully someone (or I) will be able to update it in time for Legion.

 This WeakAura tracks the status of Harmony, Wild Mushroom, and Lifebloom for Resto Druids. Here's a GIF showing it in action:

## Background

The three most important spells to ensure you always have up as a Resto Druid are Harmony, Wild Mushroom, and Lifebloom. It is important to be able to:

1. See the amount of time remaining on each of these
2. Be warned when any of these is about to expire
3. Be alerted when any of these is missing

It seems simple enough, but in my years of searching I have not been able to find an Addon or WeakAura that is able to do this for Lifebloom. The default interface does not allow you to achieve goals 2 and 3 for this spell. Any custom LUA solutions I came across online were either very finicky or unable to achieve each of the above goals.

I set out to create a unified interface for tracking these 3 goals across these 3 spells, and was able to create a stable setup. This group works whether you are flying solo, in a 5 man group, or in a raid, and is battle tested in my guild's mythic progression runs.



I've found this works best if placed directly adjacent to your healing frames, as the flashing alerts can easily be seen in your peripheral vision. This makes it effortless to get optimal uptime on each of these spells.
Hope this is as helpful to others as I have found it.
